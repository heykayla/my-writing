# Clone a GitHub Repository with GitHub Desktop

## Overview

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to clone a repository from your remote GitHub.com account to your local macOS computer with GitHub Desktop. 

This tutorial is intended for new GitHub Desktop users.

## Background

The following are a few concepts to review for this tutorial:

* **Git**: An open-source version control system (VCS) software that records changes to your files and lets you revert or review changes you made.
* **GitHub**: A web-based platform built on Git that hosts and manages files and facilitates collaboration with other users.
* **Repositories**: Folders that store files and their revision history within GitHub.
* **GitHub Desktop**: An application installed on your local computer that lets you interact with your remote GitHub.com account without using the command line and web browser.
* **Cloned Repositories**: A local copy of a repository on your computer that is created from and syncs to your remote GitHub.com account. It lets you edit and create new files locally.
